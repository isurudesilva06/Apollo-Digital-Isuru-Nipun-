# Baltimore Therapeutic Treatment Center Project

A modern, responsive landing page for the Baltimore Therapeutic Treatment Center project.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: Custom styles, including modern typography and a fully responsive layout.
- `script.js`: Interactive elements (modals, smooth scrolling, mobile menu).
- `assets/`: Image and logo assets.
- `fonts/`: Custom local fonts (SF Pro Display, Raleway, Alef).

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Local Development Server (Recommended)
To see the website locally with all features (like smooth scrolling and image paths) working correctly, it's best to use a local server.

**For Windows Users:**
- Double-click `start-server.bat` OR
- Right-click `start-server.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell".

The server will automatically try to use **Python** or **Node.js** if installed. Once running, open your browser to:
`http://localhost:8080`

### 2. VS Code Extensions (Optional)
If you use VS Code, you can also use:
- **Live Server**: Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

### 3. Direct Opening
You can simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Interactive Header**: Sticky navigation with a mobile hamburger menu.
- **Event Management**: Styled event cards with layout optimized for readability.
- **Newsletter**: Integrated subscription form in the footer.
